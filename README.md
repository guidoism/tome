# Motivations

The web — circa 2023 — is optimized for webapps. The public
needs a document-centric hypertext document format that prioritizes
legibility, accessibility, and latency to first complete screen rendering.

This is my quixotic attempt to put forth something better, 
get an official RFC published, 
and get this adopted by the document-centric web.
